# Amazon S3 Management Challenge

## Lab Overview

In this challenge lab, I created an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and performed several tasks to manage and access objects within the bucket. These tasks included uploading objects, configuring permissions to make objects publicly accessible, and using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to list the contents of the bucket.

## Objectives

By the end of this challenge, I achieved the following:

- Created an S3 bucket.
- Uploaded an object into the S3 bucket.
- Configured the object to be publicly accessible through a web browser.
- Listed the contents of the S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Creating an S3 Bucket

- **Created an S3 Bucket**:
  - Used the AWS Management Console to create a new S3 bucket with a unique name.

### 2. Uploading an Object

- **Uploaded an Object**:
  - Uploaded a test file (e.g., an image or a text file) into the newly created S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console.

### 3. Configuring Permissions

- **Configured Object Permissions**:
  - Set the permissions of the uploaded object to make it publicly accessible.
  - Verified the public accessibility by accessing the object via a web browser using the object's URL.

### 4. Listing Contents Using AWS CLI

- **Installed AWS CLI**:
  - Ensured the AWS CLI was installed and configured with the necessary credentials.

- **Listed Bucket Contents**:
  - Used the `aws s3 ls` command to list the contents of the S3 bucket.
  - Verified that the uploaded object appeared in the list of bucket contents.

## Conclusion

This challenge lab provided hands-on experience with Amazon S3, including creating and managing buckets, uploading and configuring object permissions, and utilizing the AWS CLI for bucket operations. These tasks demonstrated my ability to perform routine S3 management tasks and ensure object accessibility through a web browser.
